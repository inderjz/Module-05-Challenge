Using the application Work Day Scheduler, a person can schedule their activities for the day so they don't overlook anything important.

## Landing Page

When you first launch the app, the name of the program and a short statement describing its functionality are displayed together with the date and the current day. You may find a list of the hours, from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, under all of that.

## Hours

When the app first launches, you'll notice that some of the boxes are colored differently from others because the gray color stands for the hours that have previously past, the orange color for the current hour, and the green color for the hours to come.

## Save Button 

Each hour box has a save button next to it, and you can use that button to store an event after you have entered it in. When you return to the website, the event will still be there because it was saved directly to your local storage, so it will be there.
